## DORA Metrics: The Foundation of High-Performing Teams

**DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics** are four key performance indicators that measure software delivery and operational performance, based on extensive research by Google's DevOps Research team:

### The Four Key DORA Metrics

- **Deployment Frequency** - How often your team successfully releases code to production
- **Lead Time for Changes** - Time from code committed to code successfully running in production
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)** - How quickly your team can recover from failures in production
- **Change Failure Rate** - Percentage of deployments causing failures requiring immediate remediation

### Benefits for Development Teams

- **Measurable Performance** - Objective data to track and improve delivery capabilities
- **Faster Innovation** - Higher deployment frequency enables rapid iteration and feedback
- **Reduced Risk** - Lower change failure rates and faster recovery times minimize business impact
- **Improved Predictability** - Consistent lead times enable better planning and stakeholder communication
